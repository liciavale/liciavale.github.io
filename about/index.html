          <h2 id="title">Something about me</h2>

          <p class="about-intro">
            If I was a colour? Green.<br />
            If I was a song? I’d be High Hopes by Pink Floyd.<br />
            Something weird about me? I'm fascinated by earthquakes and volcanoes.<br />
            Do you still wanna know me? 😛

            I'm an Italian Designer that one day packed her bags and started travelling
            around the world.</br>
            I’ve lived, worked and studied in different countries: Italy, Canada, UK.
            I'm now based in London.</br>
            I work a lot with the web, UX and illustrations.
