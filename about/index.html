          <p class="about-intro">
            If I was a colour? Green.<br />
            If I was a song? Iâ€™d be High Hopes by Pink Floyd.<br />
            Something weird about me? I'm fascinated by earthquakes and volcanoes.<br />
            Do you still wanna know me?

          <p>
            I'm an Italian Designer that one day packed her bags and started traveling
            around the world.</br>
            Iâ€™ve lived, worked and studied in different countries: Italy, Canada, UK.
            I'm now based in London.</br>
            I work a lot with the web, UX and illustrations.
