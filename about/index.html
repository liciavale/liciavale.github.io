          <p class="about-intro">
            <q>
              If I was a colour? <span class="green">Green.</span><br />
              If I was a song? I’d be <span class="blue">High Hopes</span> by Pink Floyd.<br />
              Something weird about me? I'm fascinated by <span class="purple">earthquakes</span> and <span class="red">volcanoes</span>.<br />
              Do you still wanna know me?
            </q>

            I'm an Italian Designer that one day packed her bags and started traveling
            around the world.</br>
            I’ve lived, worked and studied in different countries: Italy, Canada, UK.
            I'm now based in London.</br>
            I work a lot with the web, UX and illustrations.
