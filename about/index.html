            <q>
              If I was a colour? <span class="green">Green.</span><br />
              If I was a song? I’d be <a class="blue" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jMlFXouPk8">High Hopes</a> by Pink Floyd.<br />
              Something weird about me? I'm fascinated by <span class="purple">earthquakes</span> and <span class="red">volcanoes</span>.<br />
              Do you still wanna know me? ;P

            I'm now based in London.</br>
